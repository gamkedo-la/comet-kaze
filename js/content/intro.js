Long ago, deep in the far reaches of space, 

there lived a young boy known only as “Kicker”. 

In his youth, Kicker discovered he had immense, near-infinite power 

- enough power to destroy the world around him 

- and even worlds beyond his own. 

To keep his loved ones safe, Kicker isolated himself to train every day, hoping he could control his powers before they harmed anyone else.

But in his absence, a dark force crept over their galaxy. 

The Agents of the Cosmos - followers of the Big Star - were determined to take control of every planet across the universe.

Now Kicker must emerge from his training to defend his home

Was his training enough? 

Can he control his powers and save the galaxy? 

Or will he only destroy himself and everyone around him?

Is he powerful enough to become …
